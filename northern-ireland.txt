Some takeaways from our weekend trip to Northern Ireland:
- We booked a coach tour with McComb's and could not recommend it more highly. The coach seats were very comfortable and the driver's commentary was top-notch. There were plenty of bathroom breaks, and the pub lunch was delicious (with an efficient pre-ordering system that maximised our eating time). We also got to spot some dolphins swimming off the coastline as well!
- Belfast's city center has some fascinating architecture. We especially recommend walking down Donegall Place and around Belfast City Hall.
- We enjoyed relaxing in the Crown Liquor Saloon the afternoon of our flight as it's located right next to the bus station - the service is excellent, the chairs are very comfortable and there's a good selection of food and drinks (not to mention the beautifully decorated interior!)

Our reviews of the "guidebook" attractions:
- Giant's Causeway (9.5/10): Absolutely breathtaking and a must-visit. Both the legendary and geological stories behind the causeway are fascinating, and it's easy to lose several hours here taking photos, wandering around the rocks, admiring the views of the magnificent coastline and listening to the waves crashing against the shoreline. Parking is on the expensive side (as is the case with many National Trust properties), but there's a few decent parking options nearby that are less expensive if you're willing to walk a bit further. It's important to wear shoes with good traction, as the rocks are very slippery when wet.
- Titanic Belfast (7/10): A visually-stunning building, but the experience inside is a bit lacking. The first section of the self-guided, one-way tour is an overview of Belfast's shipping industry, which is moderately interesting but the many bottlenecks meant that lines were very long. Next is a not-very-informative ride through the dockyards. The displays on the building and furnishing of the Titanic itself were informative and well-written, but there was virtually no detail on the sinking itself (other than the telegram messages sent by the Titanic) and the final section on the Titanic in popular media was a major missed opportunity to educate the public on the legends/lore built up around the ship compared to reality. It's not a bad museum per se and still worth a visit when you come to Belfast, but we cannot offer a strong recommendation as the museum could have been so much better (with "living history" or demonstrations of the shipyards, more artifacts from the wreck, etc.)
