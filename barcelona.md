# Barcelona
Our second visit to Barcelona confirmed our belief that Barcelona is one of the greatest cities in Europe for tourists: walkable but with excellent public transport options; stunning architecture; delicious food. 
While on the cruise, we received an e-mail from our hotel saying that due to an unforseen maintenance issue our reservation had been transferred to the Hotel Catalonia Square. This worked out for us - the hotel was just a two minute walk from Plaça de Catalunya, a more central location than our original location near the Arc de Triomf. A late breakfast (around 8:15) meant that the ship had mostly emptied and the disembarkation process was very straightforward - walk off the ship with our luggage, hop on the Barcelona port shuttle (3 euros per person) to the World Trade Center, then walk to the L3 station at Drassanes for two stops (to Catalunya). 
While we had originally intended to take the extra day to explore Barcelona, this proved more challenging than expected due to the need to carry our backpacks around all day (the room wouldn't be available until 3pm). Our first stop was the Sagrada Familia.
Less than two minutes away is Madre Taberna Moderna, which we stumbled upon (noticing the line of people waiting to get in at 1pm) because our original choice for lunch (Can Pizza) was closed. Lunch was spectacular - a delicious sangria followed by patatas bravas (the salsa brava was deliciously smoky, almost like a barbecue sauce), the seasonal salad "Casa Madre" (with the unexpected but delicious combination of anchovies?, green beans, potatoes, tomatoes and lettuce), roasted eggplant stuffed with vegan sobresada and creamy brie (the eggplant was presented whole and "carved" tableside by our server) and cannelloni of sausage and ceps with truffled bechamel sauce (what surprised us was the dish was presented as a single long cannelloni filled with sausage).
We then headed to Casa Battló,
