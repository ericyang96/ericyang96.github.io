After over a year and a half of little international travel it was a wonderful feeling to be finally exploring a new city once again. Madrid was perfect for this, with its historic streets and buildings designed for exploration. 

Here's some of the takeaways we've learned from our trip:
- Madrid's public transportation system is excellent, with clean, well-lit trains/stations with good frequency (the longest we had to wait was 7 minutes on a Sunday orming). Since we stayed farther out (around 40 minutes from the city center by metro), we found the 10-journey tickets to be good value, and you can buy these at any metro station.
- Do not miss the Gran Via, as the architecture is absolutely stunning. This early 20th street encapsulates the growth of Madrid into a modern city replete with office buildings, luxury hotels, theatres, shopping centres and banks, and, in our view, best captures the changing architectural styles and fashions of Europe from the late 19th century through World War 2.
- All the guidebooks will tell you to go to Chocolateria San Gines, and they're right, it's absolutely worth it.
- Our diet in Madrid consisted heavily of potatoes (patatas bravas, tortilla de patatas, huevos rotos), which we didn't regret because they were all delicious but do make sure to get some vegetables/fruit in your diet as well. The croquetas are also absolutely delicious and highly recommended.
- We watched a lot of Spain Revealed videos on YouTube to prepare for the trip, and his advice was spot-on (in particular Los Galayos as a good restaurant near Plaza Mayor)

Our ranking of the "guidebook" attractions we visited:
- Palacio Real (9/10): A must-visit if you're into history or the visual arts. The largest palace by floor area in Europe (twice the size of Buckingham Palace!), we were especially impressed with the thematic cohesion of the interior design (a product of most of the palace being designed by a single monarch, Charles III)
- Cardamomo (9/10): We watched a flamenco show here on Saturday evening, and it was one of the highlights of the trip. While tickets are on the expensive side (around 40 euros each), they do come with a free drink of your choice and the hour-long performance with singers, dancers, guitarists and percussionists is full of energy and absolutely thrilling.
- Museo del Prado (8/10): Without question one of the world's greatest collections of art. However, I've always found art museums a bit exhausting, especially as seating areas aren't always found in the rooms where you want to linger (i.e. Las Meninas), and it didn't help that we weren't allowed to bring in water nor could we find any water fountains. The museum layout isn't clearly marked as soom artists (Goya) are split across multiple floors, so planning your route ahead of time is recommended. You have to see Velasquez's Las Meninas and the Surrender of Breda, Goya's Black Paintings and The Third of May, El Greco's Fable and his many portraits.
- Museo Sofia Reina (7.5/10): We were experiencing a bit of art museum fatigue from the Prado yesterday, so we went directly to Picasso's Guernica and the surrounding exhibits. Guernica is worth the price of admission alone - it's an emotionally-gripping, horriofying work that leaves a deep-seated impression on you.
- Madrid Zoo (7.5/10): Very impressive and diverse range of animals, and we were lucky enough to see twin baby pandas while we were there (a true once-in-a-lifetime moment). The zoo itself was clean and well-maintained, though the signage could have been better (we downloaded the zoo map on our phones and primarily used that to navigate). Although we are far from wildlife biologists, we were concerned about the quality of the animal exhibits, which were concrete-dominant and lacked natural vegetation (it was generally easier to see animals as the exhibits lacked the more plentiful tree cover we've seen in other zoos). There were also a number of animals who kept pacing around their enclosures, which tends to be an indication of lack of enrichment.
